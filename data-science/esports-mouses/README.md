The website this data comes from, [prosettings.net](https://prosettings.net),
does not use static HTML. Instead, the javascript loads data on the client
side. As a result, the easiest way to get this data was for me to open the page
in a browser, inspect the html, and manually copy and paste it into a document.
Those are the `*.html.data` files in this repository.

The `.data` suffix is used to avoid github including these files in their
language statistics.
