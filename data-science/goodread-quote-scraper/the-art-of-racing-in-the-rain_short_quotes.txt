You should shine with all of your light all the time.
The car goes where the eyes go.
Somewhere, the zebra is dancing.
That which we manifest is before us.
Sometimes I believe...Sometimes I really do believe.
The visible becomes inevitable...
What I want now is what I've always wanted.
To finish the race first, you must first finish the race.
One more lap, Denny! One more lap! Faster!
Get busy mother f---er!
That which you manifest is before you
You can't know what's going to happen before it happens.
Sometimes things change, and we have to change, too.
That what you manifest is before you
To remember is to disengage from the present
