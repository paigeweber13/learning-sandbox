# Bifurcation.jl
Demonstrates bifurcation of equilibrium point of the logistic map. This is a
good example of chaos in a function.

# TODO
 - [x] add cli
 - [ ] create own project for bifurcation
 - [ ] save plots to plot dir
 - [ ] make plots dir automatically get created if not there
 - [ ] use pre-compiled plots if available to speed things up
   - or pre-compile entire project if possible????
